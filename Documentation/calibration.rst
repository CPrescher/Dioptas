Calibration Procedure
=====================
Make sure you are in the calibration module, which should be selected on the left side of the window.

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Load the
calibration image by clicking the "load image" button on the upper right side of the window.
Now you can insert the starting values for the calibration in the menu on the right. The calibration procedure
will define distance and center position of the x-ray. Therefore, wavelength and pixel width/height  have to be defined
based on the experimental setup and detector used.
Please choose the correct calibrant from the Calibrant drop-down list.
Additionally the image can be rotated, or flipped in order to accommodate for different detector orientations.
These image transformations will be applied to all subsequent loaded images in the calibration module and in the
integration module.

Peak Picking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameters for peak selection are given in the peak selection section on the right site of the calibration module,
when "Calibration Parameters" is selected.

    Peak Selection Options

By default automatic peak search is selected, which tries to automatically find peaks on a clicked ring. To search on
the first ring please click on it with the left mouse button. If the peak search was successful it should look like
this:

    LaB\ :sub:`6` \  2D diffraction image with the first ring selected.

If the automatic peak searching fails (if it does select other peaks in addition to the first diffraction ring) there
are several options:

* perform the automatic peak search on a different ring.

  - change the current ring number
  - and select the a peak on this ring

* choose single peak search, which will search the highest intensity peak around the click position, whereby the size of
  the search area is defined byt the *search size*

  - then search one peak for one diffraction ring (the current peak number will automatically increase)
  - or deselect the automatic increase checkbox and click several spots on the first ring, or any ring you like (with
    the corresponding peak number selected)

The Calibration and Refinement Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the peaks/ring(s) have been selected we can start the calibration procedure. This is done by clicking the
"Calibrate" Button on the lower left of the interface. This will calculate the geometric parameters based on the current
peak selection and then do automatically refine the calibration parameters.

After refinement Dioptas will automatically create a 360 degree cake image and an integrated spectrum. When the procedure
is finished it will jump to the "Cake" tab (top tab-bar above the image) and show the cake image.
In this image you can easily check if the calibration was successful (by checking if the cake lines are straight).
Additionally, the spectrum is plotted with calculated calibrant positions in the "Spectrum" Tab. All peak maxima should
coincide with phase line positions. The resulting calibration parameters are shown by clicking the **pyFAI parameters**
or **Fit2d Parameters** tabs in the right control panel. The current calibration parameters can be saved by clicking the
**Save Calibration** button on the lower right of the user interface. To fast reuse the current calibration later, the
calibration can be reloaded by clicking **Load Calibration**


If the calibration failed, either the start values are wrong, the initial peak selection was faulty or the refinement
parameters need to be adjusted. For a new peak selection, just click "clear all peaks" and start the the peak selection
again, make sure that current peak number belongs to the corresponding clicked ring. The meaning of each of the refinement
options are explained in the next section.

Refinement Options

The refinement options are defined on the right control panel of the Calibration module, when "Calibration Parameters" is
selected.

    Available options for calibration refinement

There are several options available:

*automatic refinement:*
    Defines if refinement is executed automatically after calibration.

*use mask/transparent:*
    The refinement can be constraint to a certain image area by using a mask previously defined in the mask module. The
    image of the mask can be made transparent to be able to "look behind"

*Peaksearch algorithm:*
    The algorithm used for searching peaks on the ring. The standard algorithm is "Massif" although "Blob" detection may give better
    results in some cases.

*Delta 2th:*
    This is the +- search range used for automatic peak search for each ring. The center value depends on the values,
    estimated by the calibration procedure, so ultimately by the initial choice of predefined peaks (Peak selection)

*Intensity Min factor:*
    This factor determines how many times the peak intensity has to be higher than the mean value of the search area
    (within the delta 2th value) for each individual ring. The lower this value is the more peaks will be selected,
    however, also the likelihood of selecting wrong background peaks increase.

*Intensity Max:*
    A threshold value which excludes all peaks above this value.

*Number of rings:*
    The number of rings on which peaks are searched.


If the calibration/refinement fails you can in principle play with all parameters. However, the most common adjustments are the
number of rings and the *Intensity Min factor*.
